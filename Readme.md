# Spotify User Data Extractor

## Usage
* Check whether all the imports in the `main.py` are installed (TODO: Add requirements.txt)
* Get a client id from spotify. How to do it? Go [here](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications)
* Run `python3 main.py`
* It asks for Spotify log in on a browser
* Copy (Click the button to copy) the token ID when redirected and paste it in the terminal and press `Enter`
* It dumps your library in a file `all_data.json`
* For now what it only gets 200 tracks, you can change it with the variable `NUM_OF_TRACKS` 

## Goal
* Finally extract my music from Spotify and add them to my Apple Music account
* Probably cannot happen unless I'm in Apple Developer Program
